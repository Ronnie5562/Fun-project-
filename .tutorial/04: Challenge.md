##  👉 Your turn

Following code will add in a 'lightbulb' 
```javascript
ellipse(20, 20, 20);
``` 
- let's stick in a few more to surround your name as if it was an actual lightbulb border

- The styling of these lightbulbs use the same code as the styling of the text.
- Make sure you change the style *before* you add in each `ellipse`

<summary>Hint 💡</summary>

Try changing the first two of the three (20,20,20) in the ellipse(20,20,20) and see what happens.

For example : ellipse(20,200,20)
