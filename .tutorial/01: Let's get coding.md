- Editing happens in  the *Files* tab (in this case, `script.js`).
- `Boilerplate code` is the example code you may find in a file when you are getting started.
- The `Markdown` tab is your guide and where to find instructions.
- The `output` is what your program is actually doing when it's running and where you need to go to see what you have achived so far.
- The `run` button is what you use to make your code come alive.
