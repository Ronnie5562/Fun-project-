# 11. Challenge : Experimentation

In this challenge try to play around with `translate`, `scale` and `color` functions and create cool effects.

## Translate
What *can* you do with the translate code? 

    ðŸ‘‰ TRY IT : Try moving `translate` code in and out of the loop
    ðŸ‘‰ TRY IT : try changing the values in it.

## Scale
`Scale` is all about the size of the elements. What interesting or unusual effects can you conjure up?

    ðŸ‘‰ TRY IT : see if you can add multipliers or change the scale. 

## Color
Remember that the color choice is all based upon the list of colours you set originally. 

    ðŸ‘‰ TRY IT : Use longer lists, different lists and make your names stand out. 
    
    ðŸ‘‰ TRY IT : Change anything that uses `%` to account for the new size of the list.
